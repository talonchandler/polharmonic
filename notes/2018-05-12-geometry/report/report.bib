abstract = {Singular-value decomposition (SVD) of a linear imaging system gives information on the null and measurement components of object and image and provides a method for object reconstruction from image data. We apply SVD to through-focus imaging systems that produce several two-dimensional images of a three-dimensional object. Analytical expressions for the singular functions are derived in the geometrical approximation for a telecentric, laterally shift-invariant system linear in intensity. The modes are evaluated numerically, and their accuracy confirmed. Similarly, the modes are derived and evaluated for a continuous image representing the limit of a large number of image planes.},

abstract = {The interaction of arbitrary three-dimensional light beams with optical elements is described by the generalized Jones calculus, which has been formally proposed recently \[Azzam, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 28, 2279 (2011)\]. In this work we obtain the parametric expression of the 3{\texttimes}3 differential generalized Jones matrix (dGJM) for arbitrary optical media assuming transverse light waves. The dGJM is intimately connected to the Gell-Mann matrices, and we show that it provides a versatile method for obtaining the macroscopic GJM of media with either sequential or simultaneous anisotropic effects. Explicit parametric expressions of the GJM for some relevant optical elements are provided.},
